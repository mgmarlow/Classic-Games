## Haxe Pong
A simple pong clone made using Haxe and OpenFL.

To build the application, navigate to this folder's working directory and build with any of the `openfl` commands.
For example, this command

```
openfl test neko
```
will run the local neko version of the game. Building this project requires that both haxe and openfl are installed and set up.
